        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>We are a friendly and competitive club based in Ealing. Our club nights run on Tuesdays from 8-10pm, across four courts and feather shuttles are used.</p>

        <p>Our club nights are used to catch up with members, meet guests and practice for upcoming matches. Following training, there is normally a visit to the local pub.</p>

        <p>We are currently looking for league standard men and ladies to strengthen our teams, so sadly, we cannot accept beginners.</p>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>We play at the Twyford Sports Centre (W3 9PP), near the heart of Acton. </p>
        <p>We are well located being less than 10 minutes’ walk from both Acton Town (Piccadilly) and Ealing Common (District).</p>
        <p>If you prefer to bus, then the 207, 427,440, 607 and E3 all pass right by. There is also ample space for cars and bicycles on site.</p>

        <p>The venue is a fairly new sports hall with good lighting, 4 courts and plenty of changing facilities. There is also room off court for bags and benches for seating between games.</p>

        <p>Our matches are played at The Dome, the home of Middlesex County Badminton, in Hounslow (UB2 5TZ).</p>
